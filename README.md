Hello! My name is Jasmine King. I recently graduated from Christopher Newport University with my BSBA in Management and minors in Computer and Information Science. I work full-time as an Associate Power BI Developer at Ferguson Enterprises. I live my first house in Yorktown, VA with my dog, Rune and am getting married in October.

Much excitement for the semester!
